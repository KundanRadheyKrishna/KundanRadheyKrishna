## Hi there 👋 I'm Kundan

## About Me 🤨
Aspiring **Full-Stack Developer** currently focused on building a strong foundation in **frontend development**.  
I have hands-on experience with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS**, and I specialize in creating **responsive, clean, and user-friendly interfaces**.

Currently, I am learning **React.js** and expanding my understanding of modern web development with the goal of transitioning into **full-stack development**.  
I also use **AI tools effectively** to enhance learning, improve problem-solving, and support development workflows while building **practical, real-world applications**.
